Hi!  
My name is Dmitry Figol. Currently I am a customer support engineer in Cisco TAC in Krakow. I enjoy networking a lot and I have CCIE R&S. On top of that I am Python / network programmibility enthuasist. More details as well as contact details you can find on the "About" page.  
I've finally decided to start a blog to document and share some interesting findings. I am using Jekyll static site generator hosted on GitLab pages and so far I enjoy the workflow. All of the content is written in Markdown, which is super-easy to work with.   
This is my first post so expect things to change around here quite a lot, especially during the first month. Some links may be broken as well, but only temporarily.  
Thanks for visiting my blog and I hope you will enjoy the content!   
Stay tuned!
