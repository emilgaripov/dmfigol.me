My name is Dmitry Figol and I am originally from Ukraine.   
Currently I work as a customer support engineer in Cisco TAC - Core Architecture team in Krakow, Poland.   
I support routers as a platform and I investigate crashes, memory leaks and other unexpected behaviour on IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS routers and switches. Right now I am temporarily in VPN team learning different VPN technologies and I am excited about it.
I also have CCIE R&S #53592, which I earned in July 2016 and hopefully one day I will also start preparing for CCIE SP or Security track.
Before I joined Cisco I was writing Python scripts in the game development industry. So I have some previous Python experience and currently I am trying to apply it to the networking field. I am very interested in network programmability and automation and I am curious to see in what form it will be in the future.   
In terms of education, I have Bachelor of Science (BS) in Telecommunications.   
Oddly enough, I had two chances to finish Master's degree: once in Ukraine and once in Germany (Cologne), but I never did. In 2016 I decided to change this and I applied for Georgia Tech online Master of Science in Computer Science program (OMSCS). It is quite hard and consumes a lot of time, but it is a rewarding journey.
