My name is Dmitry Figol and I am originally from Ukraine.
Currently I work as a customer support engineer in Cisco TAC - Core Architecture team in Krakow, Poland.

I support routers as a platform and I investigate crashes, memory leaks and other unexpected behaviour on IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS routers and switches. Right now I am temporarily in VPN team learning different VPN technologies and I am excited about it.

I also have CCIE R&S #53592, which I earned in July 2016 and hopefully one day I will also start preparing for CCIE SP or Security track.
Before I joined Cisco I was writing Python scripts in the game development industry. Because of that I am currently trying to apply my Python skills to the networking field. I am very interested in network programmability and automation and I am curious to see in what form it will be in the future.

I am doing a lot of mentoring and teaching and I really enjoy it.

In terms of education, I have Bachelor of Science (BS) in Telecommunications.   
I had two chances to finish Master's degree: once in Ukraine and once in Germany (Cologne), but I never did. In 2016 I decided to fix this and I applied for Georgia Tech online Master of Science in Computer Science program (OMSCS). It is quite hard and consumes a lot of time, but it is a rewarding journey.

Please note that the content on my website does not reflect a point of view of any of my employers, past or present.  

I am open to new opportunities and free to relocate. Feel free to reach out to me if you have an interesting position in mind.
